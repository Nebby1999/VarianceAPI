# Example Variant Pack

The example variant pack is a simple variant pack designed to showcase how the mod works.

Despite the lack of comments and a proper guide, it still showcases a few things:

1.- How to use the VariantRegisterBase, which allows you to easily add Variants created in Thunderkit
2.- How to create a very simple variant in Thunderkit
3.- How to create a very simple variant in code

Currently it adds 2 variants, these variants are not intended to be balanced nor fun in any shape or form, they mostly exist as a showcase of what can be done with the API.

## ToDo:

    * Create proper Documentation
    
    * Eventually Transform this into a Boilerplate for variants.

## Changelog

'0.0.1'

* Initial Release
