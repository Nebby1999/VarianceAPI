In this folder you can see an Example for a Variant created using Thunderkit.

Notes about ExampleThunderkitVariant's VariantInfo:

	Identifier Name: There's no set standard for identifier names, but it's a good idea to use Your pack's initials, followed by your Variant's name.

	the IsUnique boolean and the SpawnRate are not set, this is because these values get overriden by the VariantConfig.
